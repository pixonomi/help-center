          <h3>Credits and Usage:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Each identified web visitor consumes one credit.</li>
            <li>
              One credit grants 24 hours of unlimited real-time page visit
              records per identified visitor.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a visitor is identified multiple times within a 24-hour period,
              only one credit will be deducted, regardless of how many times
              they visit.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, if the same visitor returns and is identified again after
              24 hours have passed since their initial visit, an additional
              credit will be deducted.
            </li>

          <h3>Choosing Credits:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's recommended to start with half of your unique visitors per
              month, as we typically identify around 50% of online visitors per
              website.
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, if your average monthly unique visitors are 10,000,
              selecting 5,000 credits would be suitable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plans are easily adjustable in your dashboard, and your trial
              period can help determine the best fit.

          <h3>Extra Usage Protection:</h3>

            <li>
              In the event of credit depletion, our extra usage protection

            </li>
            <li>
              The extra usage balance incurs a nominal charge for additional

              limit.
